> **AI Coding Alert:** This repository was built with AI assistance. While the results have been manually reviewed, there are no guarantees of correctness. Use these visualizations for educational purposes only — do not make financial decisions based on them.

Interactive visualizations that explain DeFi concepts. Each example is a single HTML file with no dependencies — just open in a browser and explore.

## Examples

### Bonding Curve
Explore how token price changes based on supply. Multiple curve types (linear, quadratic, cubic), buy/sell simulation, and reserve visualization.

### AMM Price Impact
Visualize the constant product formula (x × y = k). See how trade size affects slippage and the difference between spot price and execution price.

### Impermanent Loss
Understand the hidden cost of providing liquidity. Compare LP position value vs holding, and see how IL changes with price divergence.

### Liquidation Threshold
Watch a position's health factor change as prices move. Visualize collateral value vs debt and see exactly when liquidation occurs.

### Concentrated Liquidity
See how narrowing your price range increases capital efficiency (Uniswap v3 style). Compare concentrated vs full-range liquidity.

## Usage

Open any HTML file in a browser. No build step, no dependencies.

## Design Principles

- **Single file**: Each example is self-contained
- **No dependencies**: Works offline
- **Immediate feedback**: Every input updates instantly
- **Show the math**: Formulas connect visuals to equations
